# FPGA License Plate Recognition System

License plate recognition (LPR) is a crucial technology in modern automated vehicle identification systems, widely used in parking management, toll collection, and traffic monitoring. This project is interesting because it leverages FPGA technology for real-time processing, ensuring high-speed and efficient performance. The motivation behind this project is to create a robust and fast system that can be deployed in security-sensitive environments, such as gated communities and restricted areas, to enhance access control mechanisms.
